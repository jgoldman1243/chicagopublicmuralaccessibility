Public Mural Accessibility in Chicago, IL
<br></br>
<p>This page is dedicated to providing information concerning public mural accessibility in Chicago, IL.

The embedded map reflects accessibility to public murals in Chicago. This data is presented through the location of registered murals, affordable housing developments, and public transportation within Chicago.

Mural density is presented as a heat map, clearly indicating where a higher volume of murals is located within any specific area of the city.  This data is then compared to the locations of affordable housing developments within Chicago and CTA rail line data. CTA rail line data is included in the map to help orient the map-user as well as present one means of transportation/accessibility to and from murals throughout the city. This data used together will hopefully help determine whether certain murals are enjoyed locally or city wide, as well as by whom - in terms of affordable units in close proximity to public art.</p>
