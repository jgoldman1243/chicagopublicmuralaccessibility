	<p>The Mural Registry catalogues Chicagoâ€™s collection of murals, and includes a growing list of completed murals created on private and public property. Click <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/mural_registry.html">HERE</a> to learn more information about the program.</p>

<h4>How Does it Work?</h4>
</div>

<div class ="murals">

	<p>Artists, organizations, and property owners may register completed murals by submitting an application. Accepted murals will be assigned a unique Mural Registration ID, and will receive an official emblem from the City of Chicago.</p>

	<p>The rental housing developments shown in the map below are among the thousands of affordable units that are supported by City of Chicago programs to maintain affordability in local neighborhoods. The list is updated periodically when construction is completed for new projects or when the compliance period for older projects expire, typically after 30 years. The list is provided as a courtesy to the public. It does not include every City-assisted affordable housing unit that may be available for rent, nor does it include the hundreds of thousands of naturally occurring affordable housing units located throughout Chicago without City subsidies.</p>

<h3><u>Mapping the Distribution of Public Murals & Affordable Rental Housing Developments</u></h3>
</div>

<div class ="murals">
	<p>The map below reflects accessibility to public murals in Chicago. This data is presented through the location of registered murals, affordable housing developments, and public transportation within Chicago.</p>

<br></br>

	<p>Mural density is presented as a heat map, clearly indicating where a higher volume of murals is located within any specific area of the city.  This data is then compared to the locations of affordable housing developments within Chicago and CTA rail line data. CTA rail line data is included in the map to help orient the map-user as well as present one means of transportation/accessibility to and from murals throughout the city. This data used together will hopefully help determine whether certain murals are enjoyed locally or city wide, as well as by whom - in terms of affordable units in close proximity to public art.  </p>
